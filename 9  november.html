        <summary>Variables</summary>
        <p>In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data. Variables are "containers" for storing information.</p>
        <p>Rules for JavaScript variable names:  <br>
            <li>Variable names are case sensitive (y and Y are two different variables)</li> 
            <li>Variable names must begin with a letter or the underscore character</li></p>
            <h2>var:</h2>

<div class="var">Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are only scoped within the function where they are declared. If declared outside any function, they become globally scoped.
    var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase.</div>

    <h2>let :</h2>
    <div class="var">let allows you to declare variables that are block-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) where they are defined.
    </div>
    <h2>const :</h2>
    <div class="var">const is used to declare constants. Once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be reassigned.</div>

        <summary>Data Types</summary>
        <p>Java script provides different data types to hold different types of values.there are two types of data types </p>
        <div>
            <li>Primitive data type</li>
            <li>Non-primitive data type</li>
        </div>
        <h2>Primitive data type</h2>
        <p>Primitive data types in programming are basic data types that represent single values. They are the simplest and most fundamental data types and serve as the building blocks for more complex data structures.
            These are immutable data types.
        </p>
        <h3>number:</h3>
        <div class="p-type">Numbers - are values that can be processed and calculated. You don't enclose them in quotation 
            marks. The numbers can be either positive or negative.</div>
            <h3>string :</h3>
            <div class="p-type">
                Strings - are a series of letters and numbers enclosed in quotation marks. JavaScript uses the string 
                literally; it doesn't process it. You'll use strings for text you want displayed or values you want 
                passed along.
            </div>
            <h3>boolean :</h3>
            <div class="p-type">Boolean (true/false) - lets you evaluate whether a condition meets or does not meet specified 
                criteria. </div>
            <h3>undefined :</h3>
            <div class="p-type">Represents an uninitialized or undefined value. </div>
            <h3>null :</h3>
            <div class="p-type">Null - is an empty value. null is not the same as 0 -- 0 is a real, calculable number, whereas null is 
                the absence of any value.</div>

                <h2>Non-primitive data type</h2>
                <p>Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, are more complex data structures in programming that can hold multiple values and have methods associated with them. 
                    It is a user defined data type
                </p>
                <h3>Object :</h3>
                <div class="p-type">Represents a collection of key-value pairs.</div>
                <h3>Array :</h3>
                <div class="p-type">Represents an ordered list of values.</div>
                <h3>function :</h3>
                <div class="p-type">Represents a reusable block of code</div>
